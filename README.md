# MBTI Personality Prediction & Movie Recommendation System

## üìå Project Overview
This research-driven project explores **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze Twitter users' language patterns and predict their **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types**. 
Based on the predicted personality type, the system **recommends movies** that align with their psychological preferences.

‚ö† **This project is strictly for research purposes and is not intended for external use, execution, or distribution.** 
The methodology and findings are solely for academic study.
